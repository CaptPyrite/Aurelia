# Aurelia

## Concept
Realistic survival game with no fantasy elements where the player wakes up in a time-traveling scenario with amnesia. The game involves planting crops, building houses, making wells, exploring villages, and completing small missions for different factions. The game is complicated and faction-based, with rewards and hospitality based on the player's progress. There are no potions or magical elements, only realistic medicine derived from herbs. The game is 3-4 hours long with simple pixel art and a limited palette, and minimal algorithms(Pathfinding, etc...) and animations.
